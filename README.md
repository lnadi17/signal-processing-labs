# Signal Processing Labs

These are MATLAB files which were created for the Signal Processing course in the Free University of Tbilisi. 
These scripts are intended to aid in learning various signal processing algorithms and techniques.

Folder `lab-guides` has PDF versions for each laboratory work in a great detail. Those guides were used to create 
`labX.m` files which implement different algorithms for the learning purposes. Some of these scripts rely on helper files, which are in `helper-files` folder. Be sure to add this folder to MATLAB path as well as the repository folder itself. It can be done through `Home Tab -> Environment -> Set Path -> Add Folder` dialog. If you want to use `pezdemo.m` for lab 3, or any other file is required which is not in the same folder as the script, you must add its folder to the MATLAB path too.
 
 Here is the title of each lab work:
 1. Discrete Time Systems
 2. Simple FIR and IIR Filters
 3. Digital Filters Design 2
 4. Digital Filters Design 3
 5. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
 6. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
 7. Discrete Time Random Processes
 8. Discrete Time Random Processes 2
 9. Image Processing
 10. Signal Processing in Simulink

**Note:** Feel free to explore the repository, but keep in mind that these files are specific to the 
Signal Processing course at the Free University of Tbilisi and may not be directly applicable to other contexts.
